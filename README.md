# Fourier Transform 
Basically the fourier transform is signal processing techniques used in finding the frequency component 
present in the given signal. Basic intution of the fourier transform can be better described by the figure
below:

Basically i've created the two sine signal of frequency o.2, 0.8 with amplitude 5 and 12 respectively
as shown in the first and second subplot, while in the third plot green line shows the signal being 
superposed. 

So to find out the frequencies present in the superposed signal, fourier transform is used.
In the third figure, major spikes at 0.2 and 0.8 shows the presence of such ferquency components.
